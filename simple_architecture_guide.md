# 🏢 The Virtual Hedge Fund: A Simple Guide to Our AI Trading System


If you want to understand what we just built, don't think of it as a complex software program. **Think of it as building your own, fully-automated Wall Street Hedge Fund from scratch.**

Instead of hiring human employees, you have hired a team of AI assistants. Each "Phase" of our project represents a different department in your new office building. Let's take a tour!

---

### Phase 1: The Office Manager (Core Framework & Orchestrator)
Imagine you walk into the office and hand a file folder with the name "RELIANCE" to your Office Manager.
The Office Manager is the boss of the firm.
* **Their Job:** They don't do any actual research. Their only job is to route the "RELIANCE" folder from department to department, ensuring everyone gets a chance to add their notes to it before a final decision is made.
* **The File Folder:** This folder acts as the shared memory of the entire company while they analyze a single stock.
* **The Tech Stack:** Powered by **[LangGraph]** (to handle the routing and routing logic) and **[FastAPI]** (the backbone web server). The "File Folder" is managed by a Python **[TypedDict / Pydantic State]**.

### Phase 2: The Data Scouts (Data Connectivity)
Before your analysts can make a decision, they need raw information. Phase 2 has several sub-teams working simultaneously:
* **The Stock Ticker Scout:** Pulls exact live prices, highs, lows, and volume for every stock.
  * **Tech Stack:** **[yfinance API]** feeds our real-time OHLCV data pipeline.
* **The Librarian (RAG Knowledge Base):** Reads live financial statements from yfinance, breaks them into key facts (P/E ratio, revenue, debt levels, analyst recommendations), and stores the embeddings in a local searchable knowledgebase.
  * **Tech Stack:** **[SentenceTransformers all-MiniLM-L6-v2]** for free CPU embeddings + **[SQLite Vector Store]** (pure Python, no C++ needed).
* **The News Junkie (MCP Scraper):** Scans Yahoo Finance, MoneyControl, and other sources to read news sentiment headlines for any stock in real-time.
  * **Tech Stack:** **[FastMCP Server]** + **[BeautifulSoup]** web scraper.
* **The Stock Registrar:** Pre-downloads the master list of **2,240+ NSE stocks** from the official NSE CSV so the dashboard can display a searchable dropdown of every valid Indian equity.
  * **Tech Stack:** **[universe_builder.py]** fetches and stores `ticker_universe.json` locally.

### Phase 3: The Specialist Team (The AI Agents + Groq RAG)
Now the folder arrives at the desks of your highly-paid specialists. Each agent is powered by **real AI** connected to a **live knowledge base**:
* **The Technical Analyst (TAA):** The "Chart Guy" who looks at price lines and momentum. Tells you if the stock is going up or down based on the raw market data.
* **The Fundamental Analyst (FAA) — RAG Powered:** The "Accountant" who now has an actual memory. Before calling the AI, it automatically retrieves the most relevant financial facts (P/E ratio, revenue, analyst rating) from the Librarian in Phase 2 and feeds them as grounded context to the LLM. This ensures the AI reasons from **real data, not hallucinations**.
* **The Sentiment Analyst (SAA):** The "Social Butterfly" who judges the public mood by reading live scraped news via the MCP Server.
* **The Adversarial Debate (Bull vs. Bear):** The specialists argue with each other until they reach a consensus: **BUY, SELL, or HOLD**.
* **The Tech Stack:** All 3 agents use **[Groq Llama 3.1-8B-Instant]** (the fastest, free-tier LLM) for reasoning. RAG context is retrieved using cosine similarity from the local SQLite vector store.

### Phase 4: The Strict Compliance Officer (Risk Manager)
Let's say the boardroom enthusiastically yells, "BUY RELIANCE!" Is the trade executed? **No.**
The folder must first go to the Risk Manager.
* **Their Job:** To protect your money. If the agents are only 40% confident but still say "BUY," the Risk Manager stamps **REJECTED**. If they are 85% confident, the Risk Manager stamps **APPROVED**.
* **The Tech Stack:** Powered by custom **[Python Logic]** for risk thresholds, and monitored by **[Langfuse]** (an open-source dashboard that tracks exactly what each AI agent said, ensuring they aren't hallucinating).

### Phase 5: The Advisory Log & The Record Keeper (Compliance Only)
Once the Risk Manager approves a signal, it goes to the final logging station.
* **Advisory-Only Design:** By explicit design, this system **never places real trades**. It is a pure research advisory. Instead of hitting "Buy", it logs a final stamped "Advisory Signal" (BUY / SELL / HOLD) for you to act on at your own discretion.
* **The Record Keeper:** Every signal — whether approved or blocked — gets a unique SEBI-style cryptographic audit ID and is stored permanently.
  * **Tech Stack:** **[Python hashlib]** for ID generation + **[SQLite]** for immutable local audit storage.

### Phase 6: The Glass Window (Streamlit Web UI)
Finally, what do *you* do as the Owner of this firm? 
You sit in your penthouse office overlooking the whole operation. You just type in a stock ticker and press "Analyze", and watch the folder move through the entire office.
* **The Tech Stack:** The dashboard is built entirely with **[Streamlit]**, displaying live updates from the backend using **[FastAPI WebSockets]**.
